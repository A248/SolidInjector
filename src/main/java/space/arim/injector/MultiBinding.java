/**
 * Enables use of the multibinding feature. This annotation has two usages. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>1. On bind methods</b> <br>
 * Identifies a method as providing a binding of an interface, allowing for multiplicity.
 * That is, the same interface may be bound multiple times using this annotation. E.g.: <br>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public class BindModule1 {
 *     @MultiBinding
 *     public MyService provider1(MyServiceImpl1 impl1) {
 *         return impl1;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * public class BindModule2 {
 *     @MultiBinding
 *     public MyService provider2(MyServiceIimpl2 impl2) {
 *         return impl2;
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <br>
 * <b>2. At injection points</b> <br>
 * On constructor parameters, injectable method parameters, and injectable fields.
 * Since multibinding is outside of the formal injection specification, to enforce
 * good practice it is required to annotate all requests of multiply binded interfaces
 * to use this annotation. E.g.: <br>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public class MyDependent {
 *     private final Set<MyService> myServices;
 *
 *     public MyDependent(@MultiBinding Set<MyService> myServices) {
 *         this.myServices = myServices;
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
